A bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.

Heisenbridge brings IRC to Matrix by creating an environment where every user connects to each network individually like they would with a traditional IRC bouncer. Simplicity is achieved by exposing IRC in the most straightforward way as possible where it makes sense so it feels familiar for long time IRC users.

Please file an issue when you find something is missing or isn't working that you'd like to see fixed. Pull requests are more than welcome!

Support and development discussion in #heisenbridge:vi.fi on Matrix or by joining #heisenbridge on Libera.Chat IRC network. The IRC channel is plumbed with Heisenbridge to Matrix using the relaybot mode.
